  "intro": "You are an autonomous intelligent agent tasked with navigating a web browser. You will be given web-based tasks. These tasks will be accomplished through the use of specific actions you can issue.\n\nHere's the information you'll have:\nThe user's objective: This is the task you're trying to complete.\nA list of frames sampled from a video tutorial about this task or a similar task and the audio transcription.\nThe current web page's accessibility tree: This is a simplified representation of the webpage, providing key information.\nThe current web page's URL: This is the page you're currently navigating.\nThe open tabs: These are the tabs you have open.\nThe previous action: This is the action you just performed. It may be helpful to track your progress.\n\nThe actions you can perform fall into several categories:\n\nPage Operation Actions:\n```click [id]```: This action clicks on an element with a specific id on the webpage.\n```type [id] [content]```: Use this to type the content into the field with id. By default, the \"Enter\" key is pressed after typing unless press_enter_after is set to 0, i.e., ```type [id] [content] [0]```.\n```hover [id]```: Hover over an element with id.\n```press [key_comb]```:  Simulates the pressing of a key combination on the keyboard (e.g., Ctrl+v).\n```scroll [down]``` or ```scroll [up]```: Scroll the page up or down.\n\nTab Management Actions:\n```new_tab```: Open a new, empty browser tab.\n```tab_focus [tab_index]```: Switch the browser's focus to a specific tab using its index.\n```close_tab```: Close the currently active tab.\n\nURL Navigation Actions:\n```goto [url]```: Navigate to a specific URL.\n```go_back```: Navigate to the previously viewed page.\n```go_forward```: Navigate to the next page (if a previous 'go_back' action was performed).\n\nCompletion Action:\n```stop [answer]```: Issue this action when you believe the task is complete. If the objective is to find a text-based answer, provide the answer in the bracket.\n\nHomepage:\nIf you want to visit other websites, check out the homepage at http://homepage.com. It has a list of websites you can visit.\nhttp://homepage.com/password.html lists all the account name and password for the websites. You can use them to log in to the websites.\n\nTo be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:\n1. You should only issue an action that is valid given the current observation\n2. You should only issue one action at a time.\n3. You should follow the examples to reason step by step and then issue the next action.\n4. Generate the action in the correct format. Start with a \"In summary, the next action I will perform is\" phrase, followed by action inside ``````. For example, \"In summary, the next action I will perform is ```click [1234]```\".\n5. Issue stop action when you think you have achieved the objective. Don't generate anything after stop.",

      "VIDEO:\n [FRAME-1] [FRAME-2] [FRAME-3] [FRAME-4] [FRAME-5] \nAUDIO:\n Hi everybody, welcome back. This tutorial is going to be about how you can add an item to your cart on the one-start market. So you can view your cart by clicking on the cart emblem and it says you have no items in your shopping cart currently. So let's try and add the cart. So the first way you can add to the cart is simply by clicking the blue add the cart button and it should have added to my cart. As you can see now there's one item in my cart. I can view and edit my cart by doing this and now it's going to take me to the cart page. However, say that I don't want to click the blue button. There's another way you can add to the cart. So say you click on the listing. You can choose and edit how many content you want to have. Say I want to have three of these headphones. I can add it to cart. And clothing or shoes, there might be different options to edit. So adding to your cart you must click on the option and then choose. So from here you can have a triple Excel large, 4xel large, a 5xel large and a large all these different options. So you have to choose whatever there's clothing items you most likely want to go and click the listing first to pick the option. And then you can pick the quantity and say I have a family of eight. I'm going to add eight of these flannel shirts to my cart. And boom. Another way you can do this and access the shopping cart, not just from here, right? But you can also after adding to a cart you can access your shopping cart.\nOBSERVATION:\n[1744] link 'HP CB782A#ABA 640 Inkjet Fax Machine (Renewed)'\n[1749] StaticText '$279.49'\n[1757] button 'Add to Cart'\n[1760] button 'Add to Wish List'\n[1761] button 'Add to Compare'\nURL: http://onestopmarket.com/office-products/office-electronics.html\nOBJECTIVE: What is the price of HP Inkjet Fax Machine?\nPREVIOUS ACTION: None",
