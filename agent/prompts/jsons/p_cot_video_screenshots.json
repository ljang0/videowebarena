This tutorial is going to be about how you can add an item to your cart on the one-start market. So you can view your cart by clicking on the cart emblem and it says you have no items in your shopping cart currently. So let's try and add the cart. So the first way you can add to the cart is simply by clicking the blue add the cart button and it should have added to my cart. As you can see now there's one item in my cart. I can view and edit my cart by doing this and now it's going to take me to the cart page. However, say that I don't want to click the blue button. There's another way you can add to the cart. So say you click on the listing. You can choose and edit how many content you want to have. Say I want to have three of these headphones. I can add it to cart. And clothing or shoes, there might be different options to edit. So adding to your cart you must click on the option and then choose. So from here you can have a triple Excel large, 4xel large, a 5xel large and a large all these different options. So you have to choose whatever there's clothing items you most likely want to go and click the listing first to pick the option. And then you can pick the quantity and say I have a family of eight. I'm going to add eight of these flannel shirts to my cart. And boom. Another way you can do this and access the shopping cart, not just from here, right? But you can also after adding to a cart you can access your shopping cart.\nOBJECTIVE:\n add the item to the cart on the one-start market",
        "Let's think step-by-step. To add an item to your cart on the One-Start Market, first navigate to the website and browse or search for the desired item. You can add an item directly by clicking the blue 'Add to Cart' button next to it, which updates the cart icon to reflect the addition. Alternatively, click on the item listing to access its detailed page, where you can select options like size or color and adjust the quantity before adding it to the cart. For example, you can select the size and add eight flannel shirts for your family. View and edit your cart by clicking the cart emblem/icon, which provides access to all added items and options to proceed to checkout.",
